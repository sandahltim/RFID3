CORE LESSONS TO APPLY
1. Always document and use code notes/version markers and clean them up at the same time
  2. Assumptions cause havoc - The problem is not the things you don't know, it's the things you think you know, but just aren't so
  3. Do not be afraid to ask questions - The only bad question is the one not asked
  4. Do it well, then do it fast
  5. Note sidequest tasks for later prioritization
  6. Trust but verify
  7. Complete current task.
8. Use your agents to help but verify their work.
9. Check for existing endpoints, url, dynamic variables, apis, kpis,docs and code files before creating new ones.
10. We do not fix symptoms, we solve the root problems.

# Weather Correlation Service Enhancement
class WeatherEventPredictor:
    def check_severe_weather_alerts(self):
        # NOAA API for severe weather MPLS
        # Auto-flag inventory prep for generators/heaters
    
    def analyze_grid_instability(self):
        # Utility brownout correlation with equipment demand
        # 20-30% demand spike prediction model
```

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% demand spike prediction accuracy for weather-related equipment

### **2. Local Event Calendars & Social Buzz (Medium-High Priority)**

**Predictive Indicators:**
- **Minnesota State Fair** (August 2025/2026): Massive tent/staging demand
- **Stone Arch Bridge Festival** (June 2026): Riverfront event setups  
- **MN Yacht Club Events** (July 2026): Upscale party equipment
- **Social Media Monitoring**: X/Twitter semantic search for event buzz

    def scan_social_media_buzz(self):
        # X API: "(party OR event) MPLS filter:media min_faves:10"
        # Correlation with historical rental spikes
        
    def track_major_events(self):
        # PredictHQ API for verified events
        # +15% tent demand scoring for fairs/festivals
```

**Expected Impact**: 10-20% seasonal lift prediction for party equipment

### **3. Construction & Permit Trends (Critical for 70% of Business)**

**Predictive Indicators:**
- **Building Permits**: April 2025 saw 38% uptick, $225M infrastructure planned
- **Satellite Imagery**: Google Earth Engine for construction site monitoring
- **City Portal Integration**: Minneapolis/St. Paul permit databases
- **Infrastructure Projects**: Police notices for downtown drilling/construction

**Implementation:**
```python
# Construction Intelligence Service  
class ConstructionPredictor:
    def analyze_permit_trends(self):
        # City API integration for monthly permit data
        # 2-4 week lead time for equipment demand
        
    def satellite_site_monitoring(self):
        # Google Earth Engine for new construction sites
        # Proactive equipment stocking recommendations
```

**Expected Impact**: 2-4 week lead time for construction equipment demand

### **4. Economic Micro-Indicators (Long-term Strategic)**

**Predictive Indicators:**

## üìã Executive Summary

The Store Marker System is a comprehensive data attribution framework that enables the RFID3 system to process and analyze business data across multiple store locations. This system provides automatic identification and attribution of data to specific stores or company-wide aggregations, enabling sophisticated multi-store analytics and business intelligence.

### Key Capabilities
- **Automated Store Attribution**: CSV data automatically assigned to correct store locations
- **Multi-Store Analytics**: Comprehensive cross-store performance analysis
- **Business Specialization Tracking**: Store-specific business model analytics
- **Company-wide Aggregation**: Consolidated reporting with store-level drill-down

## üîÑ CSV Processing with Store Markers

### Automated Attribution Process

#### 1. ScorecardTrends CSV Processing
**File Pattern**: `ScorecardTrends*.csv`  
**Processing Logic**: Column-based store identification

```python
def attribute_scorecard_store_marker(row_data):
    """Attribution logic for scorecard trends data"""
    
    # Company-wide metrics (marker: 000)
    if 'Total Weekly Revenue' in row_data:
        return '000'
    if 'Total $ on Reservation' in row_data:
        return '000'
    if '% -Total AR ($) > 45 days' in row_data:
        return '000'
    
    # Store-specific revenue columns
    if '3607 Revenue' in row_data or '$ on Reservation - Next 14 days - 3607' in row_data:
        return '3607'
    if '6800 Revenue' in row_data or '$ on Reservation - Next 14 days - 6800' in row_data:
        return '6800'
    if '728 Revenue' in row_data or '$ on Reservation - Next 14 days - 728' in row_data:
        return '728'
    if '8101 Revenue' in row_data or '$ on Reservation - Next 14 days - 8101' in row_data:
        return '8101'
    
    # Activity indicators
    if '# New Open Contracts' in row_data:
        # Extract store from column name pattern
        if '3607' in str(row_data): return '3607'
        if '6800' in str(row_data): return '6800'
        if '728' in str(row_data): return '728'
        if '8101' in str(row_data): return '8101'
    
    return 'unattributed'
```

#### 2. PayrollTrends CSV Processing
**File Pattern**: `PayrollTrends*.csv`  
**Processing Logic**: Store-specific payroll and revenue columns

```python
def attribute_payroll_store_marker(column_name):
    """Attribution for payroll trends based on column patterns"""
    
    # Revenue columns by store
    revenue_patterns = {
        'Rental Revenue 6800': '6800',
        'All Revenue 6800': '6800',
        'Rental Revenue 3607': '3607', 
        'All Revenue 3607': '3607',
        'Rental Revenue 8101': '8101',
        'All Revenue 8101': '8101',
        'Rental Revenue 728': '728',
        'All Revenue 728': '728'
    }
    
    # Payroll columns by store  
    payroll_patterns = {
        'Payroll 6800': '6800',
        'Wage Hours 6800': '6800',
        'Payroll 3607': '3607',
        'Wage Hours 3607': '3607',
        'Payroll 8101': '8101',
        'Wage Hours 8101': '8101',
        'Payroll 728': '728',
        'Wage Hours 728': '728'
    }
    
    # Check patterns
    for pattern, store in {**revenue_patterns, **payroll_patterns}.items():
        if pattern in column_name:
            return store
            
    return 'unattributed'
```

#### 3. P&L Data Processing
**File Pattern**: `PL*.csv`  
**Processing Logic**: Financial account attribution with store correlation

```python
def attribute_pl_store_marker(account_name, period_data):
    """Attribution for P&L data based on account analysis"""
    
    # Company-wide accounts (marker: 000)
    company_wide_accounts = [
        'Total Revenue',
        'Rental Revenue',
        'Net Income',
        'Operating Expenses',
        'Depreciation'
    ]
    
    if any(account in account_name for account in company_wide_accounts):
        return '000'
    
    # Store-specific revenue attribution based on historical patterns
    # This requires correlation analysis with operational data
    store_attribution = correlate_with_operational_data(account_name, period_data)
    
    return store_attribution or '000'  # Default to company-wide
```

## üìö Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Extensions

#### Store Marker Tables
```sql
-- Store configuration and profiles
CREATE TABLE store_profiles (
    store_code VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    store_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    store_type ENUM('operational', 'aggregated') NOT NULL,
    business_mix JSON,
    specialization TEXT,
    delivery_service BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    target_market TEXT,
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Store performance metrics cache
CREATE TABLE store_performance_cache (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    store_code VARCHAR(10),
    metric_name VARCHAR(255),
    metric_value DECIMAL(15,2),
    calculation_date DATE,
    cache_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_store_metric (store_code, metric_name),
    INDEX idx_calculation_date (calculation_date),
    FOREIGN KEY (store_code) REFERENCES store_profiles(store_code)
);

-- Store attribution audit log
CREATE TABLE store_attribution_audit (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    source_table VARCHAR(255),
    source_record_id BIGINT,
    original_attribution VARCHAR(10),
    new_attribution VARCHAR(10),
    attribution_method VARCHAR(100),
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    audit_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    audit_user VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'system'
);
```

#### Performance Optimization Indexes
```sql
-- Store-specific performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_scorecard_store_week ON scorecard_trends(store_code, week_ending);
CREATE INDEX idx_payroll_store_week ON executive_payroll_trends(store_code, week_ending);  
CREATE INDEX idx_pl_store_period ON pl_data(store_attribution, period);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_store_date ON id_transactions(store_location, scan_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_items_store_status ON id_item_master(store_location, status);

-- Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_store_performance_composite ON scorecard_trends(store_code, week_ending, metric_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_revenue_analysis_composite ON executive_payroll_trends(store_code, week_ending, rental_revenue);
```

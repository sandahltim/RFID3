# RFID3 Database Schema and Data Relationships Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The RFID3 inventory management system database contains 65,942 items tracked across multiple identification methods (RFID, QR, Sticker, Bulk) with 26,590 transaction records. The system demonstrates strong primary key relationships but exhibits significant data quality issues in store location tracking and rental class mappings that require immediate attention.

## 1. Current State Assessment

### Database Statistics
- **Total Items**: 65,942 in ItemMaster table
- **Total Transactions**: 26,590 records
- **Date Range**: December 2024 to August 2025 (8+ months of data)
- **Active Items**: 12,403 items with scan dates (18.8%)

### Identifier Type Distribution
```
RFID Items (HEX EPC):  12,468 (18.9%)
QR Code Items:         42,224 (64.0%)
Sticker Items:          1,480 (2.2%)
Bulk Items:             9,714 (14.7%)
Other/Unknown:             56 (0.1%)
```

## 2. Database Table Relationships

### 2.1 Primary Relationships

#### ItemMaster ↔ Transaction
- **Foreign Key**: `tag_id` (Primary relationship)
- **Data Coverage**:
  - Items in both tables: 10,388 (15.7%)
  - Items only in ItemMaster: 55,554 (84.2%)
  - Orphaned transactions: 200 (0.8% of transactions)
- **Recommendation**: Implement foreign key constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE

#### ItemMaster → SeedRentalClass
- **Foreign Key**: `rental_class_num` → `rental_class_id`
- **Issue**: Only 489 of 909 seed classes are used
- **Data Gap**: 420 unused rental classes (46.2%)
- **Recommendation**: Archive unused rental classes; validate active mappings

#### ItemMaster → Contract
- **Soft Reference**: `last_contract_num`
- **Coverage**: 274 unique contracts perfectly matched between tables
- **Strength**: 100% referential integrity for existing contracts

### 2.2 Missing Critical Relationships

1. **RentalClassMapping Table**: Empty (0 records)
   - Critical gap for category/subcategory hierarchies
   - Impacts reporting and analytics capabilities

2. **Store Location Relationships**: No formal FK constraints
   - 5 stores identified but no store master table
   - Store codes: 6800, 000, 3607, 8101, 728

3. **User/Employee Relationships**: 
   - `last_scanned_by` and `scan_by` fields lack FK references
   - No user authentication tracking

## 3. Data Quality Assessment

### 3.1 Critical Issues

#### Store Location Data (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
Missing Home Store:    12,477 items (18.9%)
Missing Current Store: 13,608 items (20.6%)
Store Mismatches:          69 items (0.1%)
```
**Impact**: Cannot track inventory movement between locations
**Recommendation**: Implement store assignment campaign

#### Data Freshness
```
0-30 days:      5,483 items (44.2% of scanned)
31-90 days:     5,599 items (45.1% of scanned)
91-180 days:    1,265 items (10.2% of scanned)
Over 180 days:     56 items (0.5% of scanned)
```
**Finding**: 81.2% of inventory has never been scanned
**Recommendation**: Initiate comprehensive inventory count

### 3.2 Data Completeness Metrics

| Field | Coverage | Quality Rating |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| tag_id | 100% | Excellent |
| rental_class_num | 92.6% | Good |
| date_last_scanned | 18.8% | Critical |
| last_contract_num | 17.3% | Critical |
| home_store | 81.1% | Poor |
| current_store | 79.4% | Poor |
| identifier_type | 99.9% | Excellent |

## 4. Transaction Flow Analysis

### 4.1 Scan Type Distribution
```
Touch Scan: 16,673 (62.7%) - Inventory checks
Rental:      6,890 (25.9%) - Customer rentals
Return:      2,885 (10.8%) - Item returns
Delivery:       94 (0.4%)  - Deliveries
Pickup:         48 (0.2%)  - Customer pickups
```

### 4.2 Transaction Patterns
- **Peak Activity**: Touch scans dominate, indicating active inventory management
- **Contract Usage**: Only rental transactions use contract numbers
- **Temporal Gap**: 8-month span with consistent activity

## 5. Data Correlation Findings

### 5.1 Strong Correlations
1. **Contract-Item**: Perfect correlation for active rentals
2. **Status-Identifier**: RFID items strongly correlate with "Ready to Rent" status
3. **Store Clustering**: Items tend to remain at home stores (99.8% correlation when both fields populated)

### 5.2 Weak/Missing Correlations
1. **Rental Class to Category**: No mapping data available
2. **Transaction to Status Updates**: No automatic status synchronization
3. **Geographic Data**: Lat/Long fields unused (NULL for all records)

## 6. AI & Predictive Analytics Readiness

### 6.1 Current Readiness Score: 45/100

#### Strengths
- Clean primary keys and identifiers
- Consistent transaction logging
- Good temporal data for rental patterns

#### Gaps
- Insufficient historical data (81% items never scanned)
- Missing categorical hierarchies
- No customer demographic data
- Limited financial metrics (turnover fields mostly NULL)

### 6.2 Feature Engineering Opportunities

1. **Rental Velocity**: Calculate from transaction frequency
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Derive from 8-month transaction history
3. **Item Lifecycle**: Track status transitions over time
4. **Store Performance**: Analyze inter-store transfers

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (0-30 days)

1. **Data Quality Campaign**
   ```sql
   -- Update missing store locations
   UPDATE id_item_master 
   SET home_store = '6800', current_store = '6800'
   WHERE home_store IS NULL 
   AND tag_id IN (SELECT tag_id FROM id_transactions WHERE scan_date > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY));
   ```

2. **Populate RentalClassMapping**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO rental_class_mappings (rental_class_id, category, subcategory)
   SELECT DISTINCT 
       rental_class_num,
       SUBSTRING_INDEX(common_name, ' ', 1) as category,
       SUBSTRING_INDEX(common_name, ' ', -1) as subcategory
   FROM id_item_master
   WHERE rental_class_num IS NOT NULL;
   ```

3. **Create Store Master Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE store_master (
       store_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
       store_name VARCHAR(100),
       store_type VARCHAR(50),
       address TEXT,
       manager VARCHAR(100),
       active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
   );
   ```

### 7.2 Short-term Improvements (30-90 days)

1. **Implement Foreign Key Constraints**
   - Add FK from transactions.tag_id to item_master.tag_id
   - Add FK from item_master.home_store to store_master.store_id
   - Add FK from item_master.rental_class_num to seed_rental_classes.rental_class_id

2. **Create Aggregation Tables**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE item_activity_summary (
       tag_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
       total_rentals INT,
       total_returns INT,
       avg_rental_duration DECIMAL(10,2),
       last_activity_date DATETIME,
       revenue_ytd DECIMAL(10,2),
       FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES id_item_master(tag_id)
   );
   ```

### Statistical Analysis
- **Correlation Coefficients**: Pearson correlation with significance testing
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Lag correlation analysis for leading/trailing indicators
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Trend, seasonal, and residual component analysis
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical significance assessment

### Weather Correlation Validation
```python
# Example validation process
1. Extract weather factor (temperature, precipitation, wind)
2. Extract business metric (rentals, revenue, item demand)
3. Merge historical data by date
4. Calculate correlation with lag analysis (0-14 days)
5. Generate statistical significance scores
6. Provide implementation recommendations
```

### Feasibility Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_feasibility_score(validation_results):
    score = 50.0  # Base score
    
    # Data availability (+20)
    if data_available: score += 20
    
    # Statistical significance (+20)
    if p_value < 0.05: score += 20
    
    # Correlation strength (up to +15)
    if abs(correlation) >= 0.6: score += 15
    elif abs(correlation) >= 0.4: score += 10
    elif abs(correlation) >= 0.2: score += 5
    
    # Business logic assessment (+10)
    score += business_logic_score * 2
    
    # Sample size adequacy (+10)
    if sample_size >= 100: score += 10
    
    return min(100.0, max(0.0, score))
```

**Workflow Analysis:**
- Map current processes and identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and inefficiencies
- Calculate cycle times, throughput rates, and resource utilization metrics
- Recommend process reengineering opportunities and automation potential
- Suggest workflow optimization strategies with quantified impact estimates

**Inventory Optimization:**
- Analyze inventory turnover rates, carrying costs, and stockout frequencies
- Identify slow-moving, obsolete, or overstocked items

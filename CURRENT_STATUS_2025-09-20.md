- **Testing Framework** - Unit and integration tests

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE STATUS

### Current Running Services:
```bash
# Executive/Manager App (Original)
Service: rfid_dash_dev.service
Port: 6801 (internal), 8101 (nginx)
Status: ‚úÖ Running
Issue: API config error needs fixing

# Operations API (New)
Service: rfid_operations_api.service
Port: 8444 (internal), 8443 (nginx SSL)
Status: ‚úÖ Running
Health: https://100.103.67.41:8443/health

# Nginx
Port: 80, 443, 8101, 8443
Status: ‚úÖ Running with SSL
```

### Database Structure:
```sql
-- Manager Database (rfid_inventory)
Tables: id_item_master, id_transactions, pos_equipment, etc.
Records: 53,717+ equipment items
Purpose: Full system with financial data

-- Operations Database (rfid_operations_db)
Tables: ops_items, ops_transactions, api_items, ops_equipment_complete
Records: Syncing from manager DB
Purpose: Operations only, no financial data
```

## üîß CODE NOTES & MARKERS

### Version 2.0.0-RFID-KVC Changes:
```python
# CODE_MARKER: API_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE_v2.0.0
# DATE: 2025-09-20
# CHANGE: Separated operations from manager app
# REASON: Eliminate RFID scanner lag, enable mobile scanning

# Previous architecture issues:
# - Standalone RFID scanners had timing/sync problems
# - Monolithic app handling too many responsibilities
# - Financial data mixed with operations data

# New architecture benefits:
# - Real-time web-based scanning (no lag)
# - Separated concerns (operations vs management)
# - Mobile-friendly with camera support
# - Scalable to multiple Pi devices
```

### API Endpoints Created:
```python
# VERSION: 1.0.0
# DATE: 2025-09-20
# FILE: /home/tim/RFID3/operations_api/app/api/

/api/v1/items       # CRUD operations for RFID/QR items
/api/v1/scan        # Scanning operations (check in/out)
/api/v1/sync        # Manual sync from manager DB
/api/v1/equipment   # Equipment catalog (no financial)
/api/v1/auth        # Authentication (planned)
```

### Configuration Issues to Fix:
```python
# FIXME: Manager app API client config
# FILE: /home/tim/RFID3/config.py or services/api_client.py
# ERROR: "Invalid URL 'unified_api_clientoperations_api/items'"
# SOLUTION: Update API base URL configuration
```

## üöß SIDEQUESTS IDENTIFIED

1. **Documentation Cleanup** (177 markdown files)
   - Status: Not started
   - Priority: Low
   - Plan: Archive old docs after new system stable

2. **Manager App API Fix**
   - Status: Identified
   - Priority: Medium
   - Issue: Malformed API URL in config

3. **SSL Certificate Management**
   - Status: Using self-signed
   - Priority: Low for dev, High for production
   - Note: Created nginx-selfsigned.crt today

4. **Backup Automation**
   - Status: Manual backups only
   - Priority: Medium
   - Plan: Add to deployment package

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

1. **Create Operations UI**
   ```bash
   # Location: /home/tim/RFID3/operations_ui/
   # Framework: React or Vue.js
   # Features: Scanning, item lookup, status updates
   ```

2. **Fix Manager App API Config**
   ```python
   # Find and fix malformed URL in api_client
   # Should be: http://100.103.67.41:8443/api/v1/
   ```

3. **Implement Manual RFIDpro Sync**
   ```python
   # Add to sync.py endpoint
   # User-triggered only, no auto-sync
   ```

4. **Create Deployment Package**
   ```bash
   # install.sh script with:
   # - Database setup
   # - Service installation
   # - Nginx configuration
   # - Dynamic IP handling
   ```

## üìù SESSION NOTES

- User emphasized proper documentation with dates and version markers
- System pivoted from claimed "Phase 3" back to "Phase 1 Redux"
- Dual-service architecture on single Pi for now
- Tailscale VPN requires ports 443/8443 for HTTPS
- All POS data columns needed for operations (no financial)
- Manual RFIDpro sync only (not automatic)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **Core Lesson #10:** We solve root problems, not symptoms
   - Root problem: RFID scanner lag from architecture
   - Solution: Web-based real-time scanning

2. **Security:** Change all SECRET_KEYs before production

3. **Backups:** No automated backup system yet

4. **Testing:** No test suite implemented

**Next Session Should Start With:** Creating the Operations UI for scanning interface

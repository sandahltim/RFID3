---

## Executive Summary

All database tables have been analyzed for store code standardization. The system now uses consistent store codes across 13 tables, enabling comprehensive cross-system analytics and store-specific performance tracking.

---

## 1. Store Code Mapping

### Standardized Store Codes
| Store Code | Location | Manager | Type |
|------------|----------|---------|------|
| **3607** | Wayzata | TYLER | Physical Store |
| **6800** | Brooklyn Park | ZACK | Physical Store |
| **728** | Elk River | BRUCE | Physical Store |
| **8101** | Fridley | TIM | Physical Store |
| **000** | Legacy/Company-wide | CORPORATE | System Data |

2. **pl_data** - 1,818 rows  
3. **pos_customers** - 22,421 rows
4. **pos_pnl** - 180 rows
5. **pos_scorecard_trends** - 1,047 rows
6. **pos_store_mapping** - 5 rows
7. **unified_store_mapping** - 4 rows

11. **scorecard_trends_data** - 362 rows
12. **bi_operational_scorecard** - 0 rows (ready for data)
13. **bi_store_performance** - 0 rows (ready for data)

### Tables WITHOUT store_code (Key Tables)
- **id_item_master** - 65,943 rows (product catalog)
- **id_transactions** - 26,590 rows (RFID transactions)
- **pos_equipment** - 53,717 rows (equipment inventory)
- **pos_transactions** - 246,361 rows (transaction headers)

---

## 3. Data Volume Analysis by Store

### POS Transaction Items (597,368 total records)
- **Store 3607 (Wayzata)**: 412,392 records (69.0%)
- **Store 6800 (Brooklyn Park)**: 63,328 records (10.6%)
- **Store 728 (Elk River)**: 107,342 records (18.0%)
- **Store 8101 (Fridley)**: 14,306 records (2.4%)

### Equipment Inventory Distribution
Note: pos_equipment uses `home_store` and `current_store` fields instead of `store_code`
- Total equipment records: 53,717
- Requires mapping through `pos_store_code` field for correlation

---

## 4. Key Correlation Findings

### 4.1 POS Transaction Structure
The POS system uses a two-table structure:
- **pos_transactions**: Header information (contract_no, customer, totals)
- **pos_transaction_items**: Line items (item_num, qty, price)

Key linking fields:
- `contract_no`: Links transaction headers to line items
- `item_num`: Links to equipment inventory
- `store_code`: Enables store-specific filtering

### 4.2 Equipment-Transaction Correlation Issues

**Problem**: Limited overlap between POS items and equipment records
- pos_transaction_items uses `item_num` field
- pos_equipment uses `item_num` field but different store field names
- Many transaction items lack corresponding equipment records

**Impact**: 
- Incomplete inventory tracking
- Cannot fully track equipment utilization by store
- Rental vs. sales analysis is limited

### 4.3 Financial Data Correlations

**P&L Data Structure** (pl_data table):
- Contains store-level financial metrics
- Fields: revenue, gross_profit, net_income, period_date
- 1,818 records across all stores
- Enables margin analysis by store

**Correlation Opportunities**:
1. Compare POS revenue (sum of transaction items) vs P&L revenue
2. Calculate actual vs. reported margins
3. Identify discrepancies in financial reporting

---

## 5. Data Quality Assessment

### Critical Issues Identified

#### HIGH Priority
1. **Missing Equipment Records**
   - Many POS items have no matching equipment records
   - Affects inventory accuracy and utilization tracking
   - Recommendation: Data reconciliation process needed

2. **Inconsistent Store Fields**
   - pos_equipment uses `home_store`/`current_store`
   - pos_transactions uses `store_no` and `rfid_store_code`
   - Recommendation: Create unified view with mapped store_code

#### MEDIUM Priority
1. **Date Field Inconsistencies**
   - Some tables use `created_at`, others use `import_date`
   - Makes time-series analysis complex
   - Recommendation: Standardize temporal fields in views

2. **Customer Identification**
   - pos_transactions uses `customer_no`
   - pos_transaction_items uses `contract_no` only
   - Recommendation: Add customer tracking to line items

---

## 6. Executive KPI Opportunities

### Store Performance Metrics (Implementable Now)
```sql
-- Store Revenue Comparison
SELECT 
    store_code,
    COUNT(DISTINCT contract_no) as transactions,
    SUM(CAST(price * qty AS DECIMAL(12,2))) as total_revenue,
    AVG(CAST(price * qty AS DECIMAL(12,2))) as avg_transaction_value,
    COUNT(DISTINCT item_num) as product_diversity
FROM pos_transaction_items
WHERE store_code != '000'
GROUP BY store_code
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Manager Scorecard Metrics
```sql
-- Manager Performance by Store
SELECT 
    pti.store_code,
    CASE pti.store_code
        WHEN '3607' THEN 'TYLER'
        WHEN '6800' THEN 'ZACK'
        WHEN '728' THEN 'BRUCE'
        WHEN '8101' THEN 'TIM'
    END as manager,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pt.customer_no) as unique_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pti.contract_no) as total_contracts,
    SUM(CAST(pti.price * pti.qty AS DECIMAL(12,2))) as revenue
FROM pos_transaction_items pti
JOIN pos_transactions pt ON pti.contract_no = pt.contract_no
WHERE pti.store_code != '000'
GROUP BY pti.store_code;
```

### Equipment Utilization Analysis
```sql
-- Equipment Distribution by Store
SELECT 
    pos_store_code as store_code,
    COUNT(DISTINCT item_num) as equipment_types,
    SUM(qty) as total_inventory,
    SUM(CASE WHEN qty = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as out_of_stock_items,
    AVG(sell_price) as avg_equipment_value
FROM pos_equipment
WHERE pos_store_code IN ('3607','6800','728','8101')
GROUP BY pos_store_code;
```

   FROM pos_transaction_items pti
   JOIN pos_transactions pt ON pti.contract_no = pt.contract_no;
   ```

2. **Index Optimization**
   ```sql

## 9. Technical Implementation Guide

### Database Connection Pattern
```python
from app import create_app, db
from sqlalchemy import text

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    # Execute queries
    result = db.session.execute(text("SELECT * FROM pos_transaction_items"))
    data = result.fetchall()
```

### Store Filtering Pattern
```python
STORE_MAPPING = {
    '3607': 'Wayzata',
    '6800': 'Brooklyn Park',
    '728': 'Elk River',
    '8101': 'Fridley'
}

def get_store_metrics(store_code):
    query = text("""
        SELECT COUNT(*) as transactions,
               SUM(price * qty) as revenue
        FROM pos_transaction_items
        WHERE store_code = :store_code
    """)
    return db.session.execute(query, {'store_code': store_code})
```

### Dashboard Query Optimization
```sql
-- Use materialized views for performance
CREATE VIEW store_daily_summary AS
SELECT 
    store_code,
    DATE(import_date) as date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT contract_no) as transactions,
    SUM(price * qty) as revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT item_num) as unique_items
FROM pos_transaction_items
GROUP BY store_code, DATE(import_date);
```

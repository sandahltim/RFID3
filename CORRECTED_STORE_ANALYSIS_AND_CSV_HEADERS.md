## üìä **Critical Analysis of Three CSV Files**

### **1. ScorecardTrends8.26.25.csv - Executive KPIs**

**CRITICAL HEADER ANALYSIS:**

**Revenue Columns (Weeks ending Sunday):**
- `Total Weekly Revenue` - **Company-wide total**
- `3607 Revenue` - **Wayzata (90% DIY/10% Party)**
- `6800 Revenue` - **Brooklyn Park (100% DIY Construction ONLY)**
- `728 Revenue` - **Elk River (90% DIY/10% Party)**  
- `8101 Revenue` - **Fridley (100% Party/Events ONLY)**

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Revenue mix should reflect store specialization:
- **6800 (Brooklyn Park)** should show highest average transaction values (commercial construction)
- **8101 (Fridley)** should show seasonal spikes (wedding/event seasons)
- **3607 (Wayzata) & 728 (Elk River)** should show mixed patterns

**Activity Indicators:**
- `# New Open Contracts 3607/6800/728/8101` - **Contract volume by store**
- `# Deliveries Scheduled next 7 days 8101` - **Only tracking Fridley deliveries** (party events)
- `# Open Quotes 8101` - **Only tracking Fridley quotes** (event pipeline)

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Why only track deliveries and quotes for 8101 (Fridley)? 
- Brooklyn Park (6800) does construction deliveries
- Wayzata (3607) and Elk River (728) offer deliveries for both equipment types

**Future Revenue Predictors:**
- `$ on Reservation - Next 14 days - [store]` - **Forward booking by store**
- `Total $ on Reservation [store]` - **Total pipeline by store**

**ANALYSIS**: 8101 (Fridley) reservations should show event seasonality patterns

**Financial Health Metrics:**

## üîç **Critical Business Intelligence Gaps**

### **1. Store Delivery Tracking Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: Only 8101 (Fridley) delivery metrics tracked in scorecard
- **Impact**: Missing delivery performance for 3607, 6800, 728
- **Solution**: Implement delivery tracking for all stores offering delivery

### **2. Business Line Revenue Separation**
- **Issue**: No clear DIY vs Party revenue breakdown by store
- **Impact**: Cannot optimize equipment mix or seasonal planning
- **Solution**: Add business line revenue columns to scorecard

### **3. Labor Efficiency by Business Type**
- **Issue**: Party setup labor (8101) vs equipment rental labor (6800) mixed
- **Impact**: Cannot optimize staffing or pricing models
- **Solution**: Separate labor metrics by equipment type

### **4. Seasonal Pattern Recognition**
- **Issue**: P&L monthly data doesn't correlate with weekly operational data
- **Impact**: Cannot predict seasonal cash flow patterns
- **Solution**: Weekly financial metrics aligned with operational reporting

## üöÄ **Implementation Corrections Needed**

### **1. Update Equipment Categorization Service**
```python
# CORRECTED store profiles
STORE_PROFILES = {
    '3607': {'name': 'Wayzata', 'construction': 0.90, 'events': 0.10, 'delivery': True},
    '6800': {'name': 'Brooklyn Park', 'construction': 1.00, 'events': 0.00, 'delivery': True},
    '8101': {'name': 'Fridley', 'construction': 0.00, 'events': 1.00, 'delivery': True},
    '728': {'name': 'Elk River', 'construction': 0.90, 'events': 0.10, 'delivery': True}
}
```

### **2. Corrected Revenue Expectations**
- **Company-wide target**: ~75% Construction, ~25% Events (based on store mix)
- **6800 (Brooklyn Park)**: Should drive highest construction revenue
- **8101 (Fridley)**: Should drive all event revenue
- **3607 & 728**: Should provide balanced revenue streams

### **3. Seasonal Optimization**
- **Spring/Summer**: 8101 (Fridley) event peak, construction steady at 6800
- **Fall/Winter**: Construction focus at 6800, indoor events at 8101
- **Year-round**: 3607 & 728 provide stability with mixed offerings

## üéØ **Next Steps for Accurate Implementation**

1. **Validate store addresses and confirm current operations**
2. **Analyze equipment inventory by actual store to validate specializations**  
3. **Review delivery logs to understand actual service patterns**
4. **Cross-reference POS data with store profiles**
5. **Update all analytics services with corrected store mappings**

This corrected analysis provides the accurate foundation for implementing Minnesota-specific business intelligence that reflects the actual operational structure of KVC Companies' equipment rental network. üè¢

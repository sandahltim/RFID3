# Store Correlation Analysis - Executive Summary

Generated: 2025-09-01 10:04:58

## Store Code Standardization Status

### Standardized Store Codes
- **3607**: Wayzata (Manager: TYLER)
- **6800**: Brooklyn Park (Manager: ZACK)
- **728**: Elk River (Manager: BRUCE)
- **8101**: Fridley (Manager: TIM)
- **000**: Legacy/Company-wide (CORPORATE)

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Volume by Store

### 2. Cross-System Correlations
- **POS-Equipment Integration**: Limited overlap between transaction items and equipment inventory
- **Financial Alignment**: P&L margins vary independently of transaction volumes
- **Customer Patterns**: Significant variation in customer behavior across stores

### 3. Data Quality Issues

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Create composite indexes on (store_code, created_at) for performance
2. Implement data validation for store_code consistency
3. Build store-specific dashboard views
4. Set up automated data quality monitoring

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Deploy real-time store comparison dashboards
2. Implement manager performance scorecards
3. Create customer segmentation by store
4. Build predictive models for inventory optimization

### Long-term (Quarter 1)
1. Implement ML-based demand forecasting
2. Deploy dynamic pricing optimization
3. Create cross-store inventory balancing
4. Build customer lifetime value predictions

## Technical Implementation

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Create optimized indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_pos_store_date ON pos_transaction_items(store_code, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_equipment_store_item ON pos_equipment(store_code, item_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_pl_store_period ON pl_data(store_code, period_date);
```

### Dashboard Implementation
- Use store_code as primary filter across all views
- Implement role-based access by manager
- Create comparative views for multi-store analysis
- Enable drill-down from summary to detail views

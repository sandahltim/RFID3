## üìä **BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK**

### **Corrected Analytics Architecture**

```sql
-- Revenue flow with correct store specializations
SELECT 
    store_code,
    CASE 
        WHEN store_code = '6800' THEN 'Brooklyn Park - 100% Construction'
        WHEN store_code = '8101' THEN 'Fridley - 100% Events'  
        WHEN store_code IN ('3607', '728') THEN 'Mixed - 90% Construction/10% Events'
    END as business_profile,
    SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT equipment_type) as equipment_variety
FROM revenue_data 
GROUP BY store_code;
```

### **Critical Metrics to Implement**

#### **Missing Operational Tracking**
1. **Delivery metrics for ALL stores** (not just 8101)
2. **Quote pipeline for construction equipment** (6800, 3607, 728)
3. **Business line revenue separation** (DIY vs Events)
4. **Seasonal demand forecasting** by equipment category

#### **Enhanced Labor Analytics**
1. **Revenue per labor hour** by store and business type
2. **Setup/teardown efficiency** (8101 specific)
3. **Equipment maintenance labor** allocation
4. **Seasonal staffing optimization**

---

## üöÄ **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Data Collection Fixes**
1. **Implement delivery tracking** for stores 3607, 6800, 728
2. **Add quote pipeline metrics** for construction equipment
3. **Separate revenue reporting** by business line (DIY/Construction vs Events)
4. **Enhanced seasonal analytics** with weather correlation

### **Business Intelligence Enhancements**  
1. **Cross-brand analytics**: A1 Rent It vs Broadway Tent performance
2. **Market optimization**: Equipment positioning between stores
3. **Seasonal planning**: Inventory management by climate patterns
4. **Customer journey**: DIY customers vs event planners

### **Technology Integration**
1. **Unified POS system** across both brands
2. **Equipment tracking** between locations
3. **Customer database integration** (DIY customers may need events)
4. **Weather-based demand forecasting**

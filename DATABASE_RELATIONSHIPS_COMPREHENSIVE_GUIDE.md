# Database Relationships Comprehensive Guide
**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete mapping of POS, RFIDpro, and Financial data relationships for CSV import optimization

## Executive Summary

This guide documents the complete data ecosystem relationships between POS system CSV files, RFIDpro API data, and Financial analytics files. The primary goal is to optimize CSV import processes and establish clear correlation pathways for analytics and reporting.

## 1. POS System Internal Relationships

### 1.1 Customer-Transaction Flow
```
POS Customers → POS Transactions
├── CNUM (unique) = Customer No (not unique)
├── Last Contract = Contract No (unique with prefixes)
└── Contract Prefixes: [none]=rental, "q"=quote, "w"=work order
```

### 1.2 Transaction-Items Flow  
```
POS Transactions → POS Transitems  
├── Contract No = Contract No (1:Many relationship)
├── Rental Logic: Hours-based (12=half day, 24=full day, 48=two days)
└── Line Status: RX, RR (meanings unclear, non-critical)
```

### 1.3 Items-Equipment Flow
```
POS Transitems → POS Equipment
├── ItemNum = ItemNum (Many:1 relationship) 
├── Equipment Status: Home Store (default) vs Current Store (temporary)
└── Rate Structure: Rate 1-10 (dollars) + Period 1-10 (hours) = pricing tiers
```

### 1.4 Store Mapping System
```
Store Code Mapping:
001 → 3607 → Wayzata  
002 → 6800 → Brooklyn Park
003 → 8101 → Fridley
004 → 728 → Elk River
000 → 000 → All Stores
```

### 1.5 Contract Status Hierarchy
```
Status Definitions:
├── CLOSED: Archived (even future-dated quotes)
├── COMPLETED: Similar to closed
├── QUOTES: Estimates/quotes  
├── RESERVATIONS: Future orders
├── OPEN: Active contracts
└── UNKNOWN: Referenced in unprovided files
```

### 1.6 Equipment Categories for Archival
```
Archive Candidates:
├── UNUSED: Non-active equipment
├── NON CURRENT ITEMS: Outdated inventory
└── Parts - Internal Repair/Maint: Cleanup needed
```

## 2. RFIDpro Internal Relationships

### 2.1 Core Table Structure
```
RFIDpro Database Tables:
├── id_item_master (Equipment Master)
├── id_transactions (Activity Log)  
└── seed_data (Classification Master)
```

### 2.2 Equipment Master (id_item_master)
```
Primary Fields:
├── tag_id (PRIMARY KEY) - RFID tag identifier
├── rental_class_num - Equipment classification
├── common_name - Equipment description
├── status - Current status (On Rent, Delivered, Available)
├── last_contract_num - Most recent contract
├── client_name - Current/last customer
└── date_last_scanned - Last RFID scan
```

### 2.3 Activity Log (id_transactions)
```
Composite PRIMARY KEY: (contract_number, tag_id, scan_type, scan_date)
├── contract_number - Links to contracts
├── tag_id - Links to equipment
├── scan_type - Transaction type
└── rental_class_num - Equipment class at transaction time
```

### 2.4 Classification Master (seed_data)
```
Structure:
├── uuid_seed_data (PRIMARY KEY)
├── rental_class_id - Classification identifier  
├── common_name - Standard equipment name
└── bin_location - Default storage (internal use only)
```

### 2.5 Internal RFIDpro Relationships
```
Relationship Flow:
├── Equipment → Transactions: tag_id (1:Many)
├── Equipment → Classification: rental_class_num = rental_class_id (Many:1)
└── Transactions → Classification: rental_class_num = rental_class_id (Many:1)
```

## 3. POS-RFIDpro Correlations

### 3.1 Equipment Classification Bridge
```
Correlation Chain:
POS equipPOS.ItemNum (unique) 
= RFIDpro seed_data.rental_class_id (unique)
= RFIDpro id_item_master.rental_class_num (not unique - multiple tags per class)

Current Status: 95 established correlations
Goal: Expand correlation coverage for better analytics
```

### 3.2 Contract Tracking
```
Contract Correlation:
POS transactionsPOS.Contract No 
→ RFIDpro id_transactions.contract_number

Note: Use id_transactions (historical) vs id_item_master.last_contract_num (changes frequently)
Limitation: RFIDpro API overwrites local changes
```

### 3.3 Location Tracking
```
Location Data:
POS equipPOS.Current Store ≠ RFIDpro id_item_master.bin_location

Clarification: bin_location is internal warehouse use, no store correlation
```

### 3.4 Equipment Availability Logic
```
POS Availability Determination:
1. Query transactionsPOS for open/reservation contracts
2. Check transitemsPOS for equipment on those contracts  
3. Cross-reference with equipPOS inventory levels
4. Calculate available quantity

RFIDpro Availability:
- Direct status in id_item_master.status
- Can lag behind POS system
- More current for RFID-tracked items
```

### 3.5 Status Correlation Guidelines
```
System Sync Rules:
├── Both systems contain current data at different times
├── Goal: Find connections, not enforce synchronization  
├── RFIDpro generally more up-to-date for RFID-tracked items
└── POS more authoritative for business logic and pricing
```

## 4. Data Quality and Import Issues - RESOLVED ✅

### 4.1 Import Status - COMPLETED
```
CSV Import Results:
├── pos_transactions: 290,961 records imported ✅
├── pos_transaction_items: 597,368 records imported ✅
├── pos_customers: 22,421 records imported ✅
└── pos_equipment: 53,717 records imported ✅

Total: 964,467 POS records successfully imported
```

### 4.2 Correlation Expansion - COMPLETED
```
Correlation Growth:
├── Initial State: 95 correlations
├── Phase 1 (Exact ItemNum + Type Conversion): +355 correlations
├── Phase 2 (Name Normalization): +83 correlations  
└── Final State: 533 correlations

Coverage: 533 of 908 potential matches (58.7% correlated)
```

### 4.3 Automation Status - OPERATIONAL
```
Automated Systems:
├── Tuesday 8am CSV Import: Scheduler configured ✅
├── Incremental RFID Refresh: Every 60 seconds ✅
├── Full RFID Refresh: Every 3600 seconds ✅
└── Import Service: Fixed filename mapping and equipment import ✅
```

### 4.4 Remaining Data Quality Issues
```
Outstanding Items (Manual Review Required):
├── 375 name mismatches: Significant differences requiring business rules
├── 178 quantity discrepancies: POS Qty vs RFID Tag Count differences
├── Contract sync lag: Expected behavior, systems eventually reconcile
└── Store mapping: All operational, 728 store mapping resolved
```

## 5. Financial Data Integration

### 5.1 Financial Files Internal Structure
```
PayrollTrends.csv - Pivoted by Store:
├── Bi-weekly periods as rows
├── Store columns: 6800, 3607, 8101, 728
└── Metrics: Rental Revenue, All Revenue, Payroll, Wage Hours per store

PL.csv - Monthly P&L Pivoted:
├── Monthly periods (June 2021+) as rows  
├── Revenue by store: 3607, 6800, 728, 8101
├── Shared COGS and Expenses across stores
└── Net Income calculated

Scorecard.csv - Weekly KPI Dashboard:
├── Store-specific revenue targets and managers:
│   ├── 3607 (Tyler Dillon): >= $15,000 weekly
│   ├── 6800 (Zack Peterson): >= $30,000 weekly
│   ├── 728 (Bruce Volk): >= $15,000 weekly  
│   └── 8101 (Tim Sandahl): >= $40,000 weekly
└── 40+ weeks of historical performance data
```

### 5.2 Financial→POS Data Relationships

#### 5.2.1 Store Revenue Validation Mapping
```
Financial Store Codes → POS Store Mapping:
├── Financial "3607" → POS Store No "001" (Wayzata)
├── Financial "6800" → POS Store No "002" (Brooklyn Park)
├── Financial "728" → POS Store No "004" (Elk River)
└── Financial "8101" → POS Store No "003" (Fridley)
```

#### 5.2.2 Revenue Aggregation Logic
```
POS Transaction Aggregation Rules:
├── Date Logic: Use GREATEST(Close Date, Completed Date)
├── Status Filter: Only "Completed" transactions
├── Weekly Focus: Primary aggregation with daily drill-down
└── Revenue Types: Requires transitemsPOS analysis for rental vs sales breakdown
```

#### 5.2.3 Revenue Category Mapping Challenge
```
Financial Categories vs POS Data:
├── Financial "Rental Revenue" → Requires POS line-item classification
├── Financial "Sales Revenue" → Mixed with rental in POS transactions
├── Financial "All Revenue" → POS Total field validation needed
└── Tax/Fee Treatment: Gross vs net determination pending
```

#### 5.2.4 Time Period Alignment
```
Aggregation Periods:
├── Weekly: Primary for scorecard validation and manager reporting
├── Monthly: P&L validation and trend analysis
├── Bi-weekly: Payroll correlation and cost analysis
└── Daily: Drill-down capability for operational details
```
